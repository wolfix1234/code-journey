About Me
Hi there! ðŸ‘‹ I'm Mahdi, a passionate and curious individual who loves tackling challenges and pushing my skills to the next level. My background includes hands-on experience in various fields, from problem-solving in cybersecurity and programming to high-performance precision in competitive sports like air pistol shooting.

While I've stepped away from full-time programming and cybersecurity as a career, I still enjoy technical challenges and exploring areas like bug bounty hunting for fun. This GitHub is where I share some of my personal projects, experiments, and interesting ideas.


Iâ€™m always open to interesting discussions and collaborations, so feel free to reach out!
